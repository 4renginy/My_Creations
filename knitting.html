    <h4>You dont know where to start</h4>
        Here are some videos to start knitting or improve you knitting skills. Most of the time we dont even know what is our skill level. 
        Lets start with this and find out what is our skill level.
  
        <h5>Understanding Knitting Skill Levels</h5>

    
        One to four with 1 being the beginner knitting patterns and 4 being the most advanced (think brioche or intricate cabled sweater designs).
        
        Some patterns and books may use different terms to assess the skill levels of those particular patterns.

      <p>

        Basic / Beginner<br>
        If you have never picked up the needles before and are looking to give knitting a try – then this patterned level is for you.
        The projects listed in this category are normally scarves, hats and cowls knit flat with two needles.The stitches will be basic like garter stitch or stockinette stitch.
        <br>
        <br>
        Easy / Beginner
        These projects are for people who already know how to cast on, cast off, knit garter stitch and other basic knitting stitches.
        <br>
        They will include simple stitch patterns, colour work and some shaping.
        <br>
        <br>
        Intermediate
        The intermediate level is for those of you who have the basics down and want to move on to something that is a little more challenging.
        <br>
        These types of projects include colourwork – like intarsia or stranded knitting.There will also be basic cables, lacework, knitting in the round and more advanced shaping.
        <br>
        <br>
        Complex / Advanced<br>
        This is the level that gives you intricate and complex stitch patterns, colourwork and shaping using a variety of skilled techniques.
        Including short rows, intricate designs and complicated charts (either for cables or colourwork).
        <br>

  <h3>Words to live by</h3>
      
    Pain is temporary. 
    <br>
    It may last 
    <br>
    a minute,
    <br> 
    or an hour, 
    <br>
    or a day, 
    <br>
    or a year,
    <br>
    but eventually it will subside 
    <br>
    and something else will 
    <br>
    take its place.
      <br> 
      <br>
    If I quit, however, <br>
    it lasts forever.<br> 
    That surrender, <br>
    even the smallest act<br>
    of giving up, stays<br>
    with me. 
      <br>
      <br>
    So when I feel 
    like quitting,<br> 
    I ask myself, <br>
    which would 
    I rather live with?“

              <h3>Pink Cardigan and Hat Set</h3>
              <br>
              This pink cardigan is done with Bernat Velvet yarn. This particular yarn feels like a silk when you knit it. 
              I have knitted the cardigan as one piece starting from the neck. Starting stitch was garter stitch and continued with that 
              stitch at the edges and bottom of the body. After finishing all I have done croche at the edges. The reason I do 
              this becuase it prevens edges from sagging or expanding. Keeps it tight and aligned.
    
              <br>
              For the hat I have used single croche which keeps hat tick and sturdy keeping the shape. The brim of the hat and the embellisments
              are done with Bernart Velvet yarn white. All the embellisments are croched to the hat.

            <h3>Blue and White Cardigan</h3>
            
            This cardigan is one of my proud works. I have used tunisian knit stitch to make it and that was my first time using 
            using this knitting style. 
            Tunisian crochet is done by a long needle like knitting needles but the tip of it is like a croche hook so you can 
            squize in a lot of stitces and knit is easily. 
              <br>
            <br>
            I have used once again Bernart Velvet Blue and White yarns to make this lovely cardigan, as usuall I have croched the 
            edges to prevent stretching. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The nature of the knitting style it is very tick great for winter time yet it is silky soft becasue of the material.
            I enjoyed this cardigan very much.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a great sweater for  little girls at the age 1-3 years old.

              <h3> Blue White dress for little dancers</h3> 
            My daughter and I adore this little dress. She wants to keep it for her future little girl.
            <br>
           <br>
            I purcahsed few balls of ruffled yarns to make scarfs When they were on sale. After making the scarfs I had more 
            yarns left being me I wanted to make somthing else from this yarn. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A ruffly skirt for a little girl would be great and started with that idea. After finishing the skirt, 
            while making the belt for it I decided to make a dress. And this is how this dress is created.
              <br>
              <br>
            This piece it knitted with cable needle round so no connections. After finishing the body 
            I decided adding strings to the top instaed of arms.

            This is a stockinette stitched vest. After knitting 2 front and back pieces I stitched them together then added
            the colar. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I thought since it is a vest and there is no pattern it would be a good idea to add pockets.
            After finishing all I went through the edges with eyelash yarn. Last added the buttons.
    <br>
    <br>
            This vest is good for 10-12 years old little ladies.

      <h3>Yellow Cape and Hat Set</h3>
      I love knitting capes becuase I think when a little girl uses it she will feel like a princess. 
      <br>
      <br>
      
      When I knit I dont only use patterns or styles I do yarn mix and match. For this project I have mixed a regular yarn
      with eyelash yarn and knitted this capr. I have used stockinette stitch because of the yarn type. Even if I had 
      patterns it wont be shown. The cape was knit as one piece then the colar was added.
    <br>
    <br>
      The hat is crochet. The brim of the hat is the original yarn without the eyelash mix.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is a great set for 4-6 years old little ladies.

           <br>
           When I saw the Bernart baby yarn at store I thought it would be a great yarn to make a baby blanket and 
           the pattern I wanted to use. And of course I did purchase the yarn and made the blanket. 
    <br>
    <br>
           The measurements for the balanket is 38 inch by 30 inches.

      Another hobby of mine is to make hats. I love to use hats myself and I make them for little girls too.
      <br>
    
      This hat is made out of 100 % mercerized cotton yarn. 
      <br>
      <br>
    
      This hat is done with double crochet all the way to the brim and the brim is single crochet. 
      After finshing the hat itself I have crochet the roses and leafs. I have also made an icord with beads and added to the hat. 
      Lastly I added decorative ladybug button to the top.
    <br>
      This hat is fun.

    This hat is my rare knitted ones. Mostly I  crochet the hats but my daughter challanged me to knit a hat with braid extension
    coming out in the back. And I did it. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I did not like the top naked so I made a big pompon from leftover eyelash yarn and added to top. It turned out to be a very 
    cute hat.

      <br>
    This tringle shawl is made out of natural colored cotton yarns. 
    <br>
    
    I have used different textured yarns and many different patterns. For example the blue loops are part of a a yarn 
    I have attached into my knitting just for one row and finished look turned out like added embellisments. 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    As usuall I have gone through the edges with crochet to make it stable.
    <br>
    I also added the buttons because it is hard to keep shawls on your shoulders all the time. If you have buttons it will 
    make it easier to wear it

          <h3>Words to live by</h3>
          When I was 
          5 years old, 
          my mother 
          always told
          me that happiness 
          was the key 
          to life. 
          When I went
          to school, 
          they asked
          me what I 
          wanted to be 
          when I grew up. 
          I wrote down 
          <br>“happy.”<br> 
          They told me 
          I didn’t 
          understand 
          the assignment, 
          and I told 
          hem they 
          didn’t
          understand 
          life.“

    <h2> Hello there,</h2>

    <p>
      It is wonderful to see you visiting my page. 
      
      My name is Ren Yildiz. I am from a generation who had to take home economics during high school. In those classes we had to learn 
      number of topics but what stayed with me is knitting and crocheting. Mostly knitting.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      Twenty tree years ago after marrying my husband I moved to USA without any family.  As you can imagine I dont have much socilizing options
      so I turned to good old knitting. Always had so many great ideas and projects but at the first issue I quit an ... you can imagine my closet!
<br>
<br>
      I have been working as a tech for a long time and this is not a kind of a job you can use your creativity. A few years ago I 
      realized I can satisfy my creative side with knitting but if I start a project I will finish it and start the next one. Well this is how my frenzy started.
<br>
<br>
      ---First I figrued out I am not able to stick with patterns so I decided not to tight up to painful patterns.
<br>
      ---Second I have my ideas and if I want to be creative I should use my own ideas to make things. Afterall they are unique.
<br>
      ---Without finishing one project dont wont start the next one.
<br>
<br>

      Well it worked out now I come up with the idea, then I searh online what patterns I can use for it, could be one simple piece or pieces from 
      differnt projects I combine them in my mind and knit the piece.
